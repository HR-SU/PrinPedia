## Data

Original data files were downloaded from wiki(https://dumps.wikimedia.org/).

JWPL(Java Wikipedia Library) was used to transform the orininal data files to some txt files.

A python program changed traditional Chinese characters to simplified Chinese characters.

A C/C++ program measured how closely the relation of two entries are by an algorithm we had discussed, and loaded the result to a new file.

Many C/C++ programs were writen to reform the txt files to different proper formats, making it easier to import data files into databases.

At last, data was imported into databases.

That is all about where our data come from.
